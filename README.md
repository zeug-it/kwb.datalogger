# kwb.datalogger
Tool for writing data comming from KWB Comfort 4 via Modbus TCP to MQTT

After a software update to > 22.4.0 it is possible to use the integrated modbus server without a special License. To get the software update (latest version is 22.7.0 [11.2022]) write to KWB technical support technischersupport@kwbheizung.de.

My final target will be a monitoring solution with MQTT, Telegraf, Influxdb, Graphana or influx chronograph.
